Introduction
================

This data specification is to be used to send invitations to complete a YES PHN
survey to clients who have completed an episode of care in the PMHC MDS within
a specified time period.

The ???? report within the PMHC MDS can be used to extract a spreadsheet in the
format defined in this specification. The PMHC MDS will populate all columns in
the spreadsheet except for the mobile phone number and email address of the client.

Once the spreadsheet has been downloaded an organisational user can fill in
either the mobile phone number or email address for each client. In order for
and invitation to be sent at least one of mobile phone number or email address
must be provided.

After filling in the information, the user can reupload the file to the PMHC MDS.
The PMHC MDS has been integrated with the OMSSS. The PMHC MDS will request OMSSS
send invitations to each client to fill in a YES PHN survey.
